#personal 
So guys, I am facing demons. Do not be afraid, it is just a metaphor. I am fighting demons that overcome my trading self every now and then. 
I have set specific rules. From time to time I break them. I want succeeding so much, I want freedom so much, that it hurts. 
We are not meant to work every day from 7-16, that is not what life is about. Giving your living time in exchange for money. Money you spent bying on things you do NOT need. 

It embarrasing. Having the technical skills not using them properly. 

Today was a Low Probability day. And I watched and traded nevertheless. Even I felt it would be better to just go play with you guys.

Joe I am coming, Wölfi lets get a book. About trekker and Hänger:)

Love you all, I will get it. Honestly.
