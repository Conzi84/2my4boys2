Today is Tuesday. We are all some kind of coughing and a little bit sick. But we all together are looking forward to our vacation next week. We will see the ocean - northern sea, we will be having a jump in the pool and some nice talks with our friends.

You, Eli, are our oldest son, you will leave the gymnasium, as its called in germany. The pressure which was put on your shoulders, was too heavy. You could not stand. The ever and ever recurring question, I ask myself...

** How can we teach you the really important stuff for life ** 

Like.
Honesty, Love, Be Kind to others, Trust yourself, Live in the moment, Do Not fear anything...

How?
