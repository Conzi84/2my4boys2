Today is your aunt susi s Birthday. We are all getting older and Order. Making memories together. Some good, some Bad. But we share. I seid Not call My sister that day, I only wrote a message, letting her know she is in My mind. 
We were on trekking vacation Last year in Portugal. It was really tough walking together such a Long way. We did. Not always agreed with each other. But we decided to give it another Try. This year Schottland will be our destination. Looking forward. Everything that counts, is the Moment we live in. Enjoy.
