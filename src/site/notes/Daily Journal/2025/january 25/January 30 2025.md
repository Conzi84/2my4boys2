#personal 
Thursday. Its rainy. Its cold. There is Not much to say about today. 3 of you 4 are still some Kind of Sick and staying at home. Tomorrow is the Last day Before vacation. There were no rumors from yâ€˜all, that is new. At least one of you is always having a Bad mood, when we travel. 

Maybe our Last Trip to Prague in (thinking) November 2024 was a Great experience as a Family. Some Moments we felt lost together. Not knowing which Train to take, which way to Walk, where to sit in an overbooked Train. What a mess it was. How awful everything felt, But we as a Family grew together. 

Travelling expands the mind, different cultures enhance our growth. Let it be.
Love you.
