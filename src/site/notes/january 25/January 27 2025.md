Today is monday and you both, vali and eli, were the only ones who got to school. Your 2 brothers, joe and wölfi stayed at home. Next saturday we want to leave and go on vacation to denmark. Joe and wölfi are coughing really hard, so they stay at home.

Mami is with them. Managing the family as you probably know. 

What is the purpose of this journal I am writing. 

Well, I do'nt even know properly. I want to tell you so much. I want to so much learnings for your life. Most of the time you dont listen when I speak, so maybe I hope you will read someday. 

In love mama
